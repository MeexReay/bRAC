# Using as crate

This article describes how to use the client as rust crate

## Installation

To use exact version:

```toml
[dependencies.bRAC]
git = "https://github.com/MeexReay/bRAC"
tag = "0.1.2+2.0"
default-features = false
```

To use with latest changes:

```toml
[dependencies.bRAC]
git = "https://github.com/MeexReay/bRAC"
default-features = false
```

`default-features = false` here removes GTK4 gui from installation.

## Usage

As the code structure was changed like about gazillion times, 
you need to explore it yourself, if you are using an old version. 
Here is example of usage on commit [80e7b8c](https://github.com/MeexReay/bRAC/commit/80e7b8c50642f9b76be06980305ed03253858d0c)

```rust
use bRAC::proto::*;
use std::error::Error;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let mut conn = connect("wracs://meex.lol", None)?; 
    // read docs/url.md
    
    // this keep-alive way with only one connection
    // works only for WRAC, for a regular RAC,
    // you have to connect to the server on each request

    send_message(&mut conn, "<dude> hi RAC-loving kikes!")?;
    register_user(&mut conn, "dude", "password")?;
    send_message_auth(&mut conn, "dude", "password", "my auth message")?;
    send_message_spoof_auth(&mut conn, "<dude> this message totally fucks auth system")?;

    let (mut all_messages, last_size) = read_messages(&mut conn, 10, 0, false)?.unwrap(); // limits with 10 messages

    /* imagine that new messages were written here */

    let (mut new_messages, last_size) = read_messages(&mut conn, 10, last_size, true)?.unwrap(); // chunked reading!

    all_messages.append(&mut new_messages);

    println!("all_messages: {all_messages:?}. last_size: {last_size}");

    Ok(())
}
```
